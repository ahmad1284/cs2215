Js is used for interactivity
It was mostly for client side, now is used on server side also
u can use js to build webapps(express, nodejs) and desktop(electron)

Js is Event driven programming language

EventListener (Listen to an event and then do x)


Printing
--------
alert
console

Variables
---------
const : can't change
let : Specific scope, block, loop, function
var : global

DOM (Document Object Model)
--------------------------
Something like a tree representing the structure of the web

we can access elements using element, class or id

documentQuerySelector ?

innerHtml?

querySelector has limitation

addEventListener to the rescue (
    
)
